Invest in Spain

As the Spanish economy has returned to fairly impressive growth, so has Spain's property market. The residential real estate sector has entered into recovery mode with all regions of the country reporting price increases into 2016, the one exception being Navarre. The market has really only just turned at the start of 2016 as prices were still heading in a downwards direction throughout 2015, albeit the year recorded only a small 0.8% drop. Buy-to-let rental yields are rising and now average 5.5% nationwide. With rental rates having risen around 3% year over the past year, it is safe to assume that this may well be time to venture into the market whilst it isn't far off the bottom rung.
